Built a Node.js server with full CRUD functionality using Express and MongoDB. Defined routes in userRouter.js and connected them to app.js. Used Mongoose for schema/model creation, .env for environment variables, and Postman for testing endpoints. Implemented middleware, async/await for async handling, and used Nodemon for automatic server reload during development.
