Created a server and used four basic operations known as CRUD. In the userRouter.js file, I inserted all the server routes, and I connected it to app.js as a router, and I also connected the MongoDB database there. For the secret data I used .env and in .gitignor I inserted the unnecessary node_modules folder. In userModel, I created a scheme, that is, the creation of a model that will be used in the database and connected it to userRouter.js. To test the correctness of the routes, I used Postman to send requests and receive responses. I used middleware to print the data in json. Async await to wait for the execution of an asynchronous function to be synchronous and not to interrupt the process. I installed the npm package nodemon for hot reload of the server and inserted it into "start": nodemon app.js and used it in the terminal as npm start to start the server which I put on port 8080 or localhost without deployment.
